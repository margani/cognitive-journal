# Journal Entry - July 6, 2025

- Today I worked on the cognitive journal app, focusing on improving the user interface and fixing some bugs.
- I also spent some time reflecting on my recent entries and found it helpful to see my progress
- I plan to add more features in the coming weeks, such as better search functionality and tagging.
- I finished milk today, I should buy more tomorrow.
- I also need to remember to buy more eggs, as I'm running low.
- I had a great conversation with a friend about our goals for the next few months, which helped me clarify my own.
